#Some notes on branches on merging
#To make a branch use $ git branch thenameofyourbranch
#To navigate to the branch use $ git checkout thenameofyourbranch
#A message will appear that says "Switched to branch 'thenameofyourbranch'"
#You can make whatever changes in your branch that you want
#To go back to the master use $ git checkout master or to see branches use $ git show-branch
#You can git add and commit branches just like you would the master.
#To merge with the master, you must first git add and commit. Then:
# $ git checkout master $ git merge thenameofyourbranch
